                <p><em>WEB Bootcamp <strong>Student at <a href="https://www.udemy.com/cart/success/337409950/">Udemy.com</a> </strong></em> </p>
                <p>I here present you, courteous reader, with the record of a remarkable
                    period in my life: according to my application of it, I trust that it
                    will prove not merely an interesting record, but in a considerable degree
                    useful and instructive.  In _that_ hope it is that I have drawn it up;
                    and _that_ must be my apology for breaking through that delicate and
                    honourable reserve which, for the most part, restrains us from the public
                    exposure of our own errors and infirmities.  Nothing, indeed, is more
                    revolting to English feelings than the spectacle of a human being
                    obtruding on our notice his moral ulcers or scars, and tearing away that
                    "decent drapery" which time or indulgence to human frailty may have drawn
                    over them; accordingly, the greater part of _our_ confessions (that is,
                    spontaneous and extra-judicial confessions) proceed from demireps,
                    adventurers, or swindlers: and for any such acts of gratuitous
                    self-humiliation from those who can be supposed in sympathy with the
                    decent and self-respecting part of society, we must look to French
                    literature, or to that part of the German which is tainted with the
                    spurious and defective sensibility of the French.  All this I feel so
                    forcibly, and so nervously am I alive to reproach of this tendency, that
                    I have for many months hesitated about the propriety of allowing this or
                    any part of my narrative to come before the public eye until after my
                    death (when, for many reasons, the whole will be published); and it is
                    not without an anxious review of the reasons for and against this step
                    that I have at last concluded on taking it.
